# Air Quality Visualization

An interactive visualization of global air quality using D3.js. This project allows users to explore air pollution levels for various pollutants across different countries. The map dynamically updates based on the selected pollutant, with color gradients indicating pollution levels.

## Features:
- Interactive world map displaying air quality data by country
- Dropdown menu to select different pollutants (e.g., PM2.5, NO2, CO)
- Color-coded countries based on average pollution levels
- Tooltip with detailed air quality information on hover
- Color bar legend indicating the range of pollution levels

## Technologies Used:
- D3.js for visualization
- GeoJSON for mapping geographical data
- CSV data processing with D3

## Setup Instructions:
1. Clone the repository:
